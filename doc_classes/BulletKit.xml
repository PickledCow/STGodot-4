		Abstract base class for defining shared properties of bullets in a bullet pool.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A BulletKit is a description of bullets to exist in a pool. The base BulletKit has properties that are shared with all types of bullets which ends up being mainly just rendering. Internally, each type of BulletKit has a BulletPool that controls the behaviour of the bullets in the pool but this is not exposed to Godot.

		<member name="facing_up" type="bool" setter="set_facing_up" getter="get_facing_up" default="true">
			Flag for if the bullet sprites in the spritesheet are facing up or right. Other configuartions are currently unsupported.
		</member>
		<member name="fade_time" type="float" setter="set_fade_time" getter="get_fade_time" default="8.0">
			The number of game ticks a bullet takes to finish its spawning animation. This value is ignored if the bullet is set to spawn instantly.
		</member>
		<member name="material" type="Material" setter="set_material" getter="get_material">
			The [Material](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_material.html) used for rendering the bullets. Unless you know what you're doing only use the provided materials.
		</member>
		<member name="texture" type="Texture2D" setter="set_texture" getter="get_texture">
			The spritesheet that bullets in this kit use.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_width" type="float" setter="set_texture_width" getter="get_texture_width" default="0.0">
			The width of the spritesheet. Make sure to set this value or else you will not be able to see any bullets.
		</member>
		<member name="time_scale" type="float" setter="set_time_scale" getter="get_time_scale" default="1.0">
			The speed multiplier at which the BulletKit operates at. For example, if set to `2.0` the bullets will move twice as fast.
			This value is independent between kits so if you want all kits to have the same time scale you must set it for all kits.
